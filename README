MMseqs2 Search GUI

A user-friendly Gradio-based graphical interface for performing sequence similarity searches using MMseqs2 against various pre-indexed databases from the DFVF Fungal Virulence Database.

Description

This project provides a simple, interactive web interface built with Gradio, allowing researchers to easily query biological sequences against specialized databases using the powerful MMseqs2 suite. It abstracts the command-line complexities of MMseqs2, making it accessible to a broader audience. The primary databases included are derived from the DFVF Fungal Virulence Database, focusing on animal, herb, plant, Vertebrata, and Invertebrata entries.
Features

    Intuitive GUI: Easy selection of target databases via a web interface.

    MMseqs2 Integration: Leverages the speed and accuracy of MMseqs2 for sequence similarity searches.

    Pre-indexed Databases: Ready-to-use databases from the DFVF Fungal Virulence Database.

    Flexible Input: Allows direct pasting of sequences or uploading of FASTA files.

    Results Display: Presents search results in an easily parsable format (e.g., tabular).

Databases

The following pre-indexed databases from the DFVF Fungal Virulence Database are available for selection:

    Animals (358 Entries)

    Herb (475 Entries)

    Plants (158 Entries)

    Vertebrata (944 Entries)

    Invertebrata (45 Entries)

    All (2058 Entries - a combined database of all above)

These databases are assumed to be pre-indexed using mmseqs createdb and mmseqs createindex and stored in a designated directory.
